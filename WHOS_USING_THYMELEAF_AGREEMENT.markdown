'Who's using Thymeleaf' Logo and Trademark Agreement
----------------------------------------------------

This text documents the conditions under which Thymeleaf asks its users permission to use their logo and associated trademarks at the *'Who's using Thymeleaf'* section of its website and project presentations.

By agreeing on this text, you are helping Thymeleaf a lot. So first of all: **THANK YOU**.


### 1. Definitions

  * _"Thymeleaf"_ means the "Thymeleaf Project organization and members".
  * _"Technology"_ means the software and documentation artifacts created and distributed by Thymeleaf.
  * _"You"_ means the individual who agrees to the terms explained in this text, acting on behalf of the Thymeleaf User.
  * _"Thymeleaf User"_ means the company or organization using the Technology, willing to allow Thymeleaf to display its logo and/or trademarks on Thymeleaf's website and presentations.
  * _"Presentation"_ means any kind of digital or printed document explaining aspects of the Technology suitable to be used for training or marketing purposes by Thymeleaf.

### 2. Main Conditions

  * You must be entitled --in a way Thymeleaf considers proven enough-- by the Thymeleaf User to agree on these conditions on the User's behalf.
  * You will provide Thymeleaf with:
  	1. A copy of the official Thymeleaf User **logo** in a common digital image format (.svg, .png, .gif...), in high resolution. White background is preferred, if possible.
  	2. A brief **description** of the work you do with the Technology or how you use it, with as much detail as you wish, in no more than 100 words.
  	3. A **URL** your logo and/or description will link to from the Thymeleaf's website.
  * You grant Thymeleaf a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free permission to display this logo and description at:
	1. The _'Who's using Thymeleaf'_ section at the **Thymeleaf's website**.
	2. **Presentations** about the Technology, used at events, websites, webinars, etc.

### 3. Usage

  * Thymeleaf will never modify Your provided logo or texts, other than to scale them to the right size in order to be displayed.
  * Due to space restrictions, Thymeleaf might decide not to include Your logo or description, or include only your logo (and not your description) in a Presentation. If that is the case, such Presentation will always include the URL of the _'Who's using Thymeleaf'_ section of the Thymeleaf website, where all logos and descriptions will be displayed.
  * In no case the logos and/or descriptions on the _'Who's using Thymeleaf'_ section of the website or Presentations will be displayed in any specific order at Your request. Thymeleaf, however, guarantees that all logos and descriptions in these sections will be displayed in the same size/proportion.
  * You understand and agree that Presentations may be uploaded to Presentation-sharing websites (like e.g. _slideshare.net_) and also downloaded from the Thymeleaf website by third parties. You also agree that Thymeleaf cannot be made responsible for the use these third parties make of your logo and/or description.
  * You grant Thymeleaf permission to upload Your logo and description text to Thymeleaf's project-hosting systems (e.g. GitHub). This is a technical requirement in order to being able to display them.

### 4. Cancellation

  * You have the right to cancel the display of your logo and description at the Thymeleaf website and Presentations at any moment. Thymeleaf will remove them from its website as soon as possible after your request, as well as cease including them in any Presentation files created from then on. An email to the Thymeleaf team members will be enough to request this cancellation.
  * You agree that Thymeleaf may remove Your logo and description from the website and presentations at any time for website reorganization reasons, or even cancel the _'Who's using Thymeleaf'_ section completely, without previous notice.
