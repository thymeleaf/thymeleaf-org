WallRide is an open-source, 100% pure Java multilingual CMS especially made for developers
by Tagbangers, inc. It was developed using Spring Framework, Hibernate and Thymeleaf, and carefully designed
for maintainability and customizability.

Taking advantage of Thymeleaf, WallRide can separate templates completely from the system. For example,
users can upload templates written with Thymeleaf to Amazon S3, and of course use local file systems. WallRide can
also provide frontend developers with custom Thymeleaf dialects that allow them to place
specific content in the specific section of the screen they want by only modifying templates,
without server-side modification.
