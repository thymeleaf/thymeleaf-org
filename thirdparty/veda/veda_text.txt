VEDA GmbH is a German Software Development Company which creates dynamic, integrated and agile HR Management Software.

We were looking for a powerful template language for the frontend of our modern web-based products. Thymeleaf is simple to learn and easy to handle allowing us to write wonderful clean code considering separation of concerns.

The simple syntax, Thymeleaf's seemless Spring framework integration and its executable templates are the reasons why VEDA GmbH is using this professional open source solution.
