Enonic is an open source technology company. We're on a mission to simplify digital transformation. Thymeleaf
is the default HTML templating engine in our Web Operating System - Enonic XP.

Our customers use Enonic XP to build and deliver enterprise scale sites and web applications internationally.
Enonic XP supports pluggable template engines, but ships by default with XSLT and Mustache for XML and JSON
rendering respectively.

While searching for a better way to produce HTML - we discovered Thymeleaf. The brilliant idea of enabling
static HTML files to be templates simultaneously blew our mind. Thymeleaf was the obvious choice when
selecting the default HTML templating engine for Enonic XP.
