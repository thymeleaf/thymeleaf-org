Broadleaf is an open source, enterprise-ready eCommerce solution developed using the widely adopted Spring Framework. We built our 2.0 demo site in Thymeleaf.

After an overwhelmingly positive building experience, picking a templating language for our admin tool when we were replatforming was obvious. We currently leverage Thymeleaf for both our 3.0 demo site and internal admin tool. 

The flexibility and extension hooks Thymeleaf provided made it the easy choice for a framework that embodies the same characteristics.
