Trabe is a company based in Spain mainly focused on web development using Java and Ruby On Rails.

We discovered Thymeleaf at a very early stage and, from the very begining, we loved the tidiness and readability of its templates. We were at the time looking for a replacement for JSP in our Java stack and we ended up combining Spring MVC and Thymeleaf. 

Since then we have successfully developed a variety of internet and intranet applications using this combination. Thymeleaf has also improved our workflow, easing the communication between the different profiles involved in our projects.
