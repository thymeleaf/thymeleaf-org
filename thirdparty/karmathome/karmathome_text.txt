Karmathome is an accommodation social network born in 2014. Free and safe, based on the experience of sharing holiday accommodation between friends and friends of friends.

Karmathome uses Thymeleaf for its user presentation cover so as to attain a perfect integration with the technological stack used in its view, that is, Spring MVC, HTML5, JQuery and Bootstrap. Thymeleaf allows us to create the perfect mockup/model and its subsequent integration in the project in a fast and simple way.
