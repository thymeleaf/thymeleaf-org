# Thymeleaf Contributor License Agreements

This folder contains the Contributor License Agreements for the
Thymeleaf project.

There are two versions:

   * **Individual CLA**: For individuals acting on their own behalf, i.e. not
     being backed by any company or government, and not making their
     contributions potentially under the effect of any contracts, agreements or
     laws that could cause their employeer (or any other entities) claim
     any rights on their contribution.
   * **Corporate CLA**: For corporate entities allowing some of their employees
     to contribute to Thymeleaf on the entity's behalf.

## Current versions of the CLA

   * The current version of the Thymeleaf Individual CLA is **20210207**.
   * The current version of the Thymeleaf Corporate CLA is **20210207**.


## Signing the Thymeleaf INDIVIDUAL Contributor License Agreement

The Thymeleaf Individual Contributor License Agreement can be signed online
on GitHub when performing a pull request. A CLA Assistant will require you
to sign the CLA on your first contribution, or again when the CLA is modified.

However, if you prefer to send a signed document, you download the
`THYMELEAF_CLA_INDIVIDUAL.pdf` file from this folder ([direct link][individual-cla])
and follow the instructions below on how to sign and send this PDF.

## Signing the Thymeleaf CORPORATE Contributor License Agreement

In order to sign the Thymeleaf Corporate Contributor License Agreement, you
need to download the `THYMELEAF_CLA_CORPORATE.pdf` file from this folder
([direct link][corporate-cla]) and follow the instructions below on how to sign
and send this PDF.

**Important** please note that Corporate CLAs need to be sent accompanied by
a list of the corporation's employees that are authorized to contribute to the
project. For each employee, this list must include:

  * Name
  * Email
  * Country
  * GitHub user name

## How to sign a CLA in PDF format

Contributor License Agreement files in PDF format include a form you can fill.
Many PDF tools allow the signing of PDFs.

If you open the PDF file with Adobe Acrobat
Reader, you will find in your sidebar a _Fill & Sign_ option:

![Fill & Sign](https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-org/blob/main/misc/pdf_cla_images/pdf_fill_sign.png)

This will allow you to fill in all the form fields. At the end of the document
you will find a space for your signature, which you can add with the _Sign_
option that will appear in your toolbar while in _Fill & Sign_ mode:

![Sign](https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-org/blob/main/misc/pdf_cla_images/pdf_sign.png)

Once done, save the file (note this will disable any further edits) and send
it via email to [the project leads][thymeleaf-team].

**Alternatively** you can also print the filled form and then scan it.
